# gbpig
gbpig is the German Biometric Passport Image Generator. It was originally some
GIMP templates, but is now a Python script that takes any image along with the
following metadata in JSON format:

  * Y-coordinate of the chin
  * Y-coordinate of the top of head
  * Coordinate of the left eye
  * Coordinate of the right eye
  * Coordinate of tip of nose

These, along with the source image, are fed into the script which generates a
printable version.

It has been generated from a template that was created from the orginal
Bundesdruckerei PDFs and that works for both adults and children under the age
of 10. Original documentation can be found here:

  * [For children](https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/DE/veroeffentlichungen/themen/moderne-verwaltung/ausweise/passbild-schablone-kinder.pdf)

## Detailed Install instructions
### For Ubuntu Users

Note: the following guide is tailored for ubuntu users. Other distros or OSes might have different procedures, which you can follow on the official pages for each project.

1. Download or clone this github repo. Navigate into the repo folder and make sure you pull the submodule [geo](https://github.com/johndoe31415/geo) with the following command in the terminal.
```shell
git submodule update --init
```
2. Install GIMP or any image processing tool for your distribution.
```shell
sudo apt-get install gimp #ubuntu
```
3. Make sure to install the following packages that are important for usage with the Imagemagick tool (i.e) some of the important dependencies.
```shell
sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libfreetype6-dev libltdl-dev -y
```
4. Next let's install [Imagemagick 7.1.1-45](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/releases)(latest at this time) by compiling from source. Use these commands below or follow the [offical guideâœ…](https://imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php)
```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch 7.1.1-45 https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick.git ImageMagick-7.1.1
cd ImageMagick-7.1.1
./configure --with-modules
make -j8
sudo make install
```

### For Windows Users

1. Download or clone this github repo. Navigate into the repo folder and make sure you pull the submodule [geo](https://github.com/johndoe31415/geo) with the following command in the Command Prompt.
```cmd
git.exe submodule update --init
```

2. Download the latest **ImageMagick Windows Binary Release** (e.g., 'ImageMagick-7.1.1-47-Q16-HDRI-x64-dll.exe') from the [official download page](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php#windows).  

3. During installation, make sure to check the option **"Add application directory to your system PATH"**.  
   If you forgot, you can add it manually:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, go to **Advanced > Environment Variables**
   - Under **System variables**, find `Path`, click **Edit**, and add your ImageMagick application directory, e.g.:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\ImageMagick-7.1.1-Q16\
     ```

4. Use `python.exe gbpig` instead of `./gbpig` in the following usage instructions. For example:

   ```cmd
   python.exe gbpig example.json example_print_me.jpg
   ```

## Usage
Create the JSON file:

Open the image with GIMP or any image processing tool. Use the crosshair to find the coordinates of the POIs.

```json
{
    "image": {
        "filename": "my_pretty_image.jpg"
    },
    "pois": {
        "chin_y": 2123,
        "head_y": 773,
        "left_eye": [ 3086, 1436 ],
        "right_eye": [ 3428, 1431 ],
        "nose": [ 3268, 1683 ]
    }
}
```

And then:

```
$ ./gbpig example.json example_print_me.jpg
```

If you want to use the parameters for children, do:

```
$ ./gbpig -t child example.json example_print_me.jpg
```

All parameters are shown on the help page:

```
$ ./gbpig --help
usage: gbpig [-h] [-r dpi] [-t {adult,child}] [-b mm] [-l mm] [-W mm] [-H mm]
             [-c] [-v]
             json_input_filename image_output_filename

                        points of interest (POIs) in pixel coordinates.
  image_output_filename
                        Output image file.

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -r dpi, --resolution dpi
                        Output image resolution in dpi. Defaults to 300 dpi.
  -t {adult,child}, --picture-type {adult,child}
                        Give the picture type. Can be any of adult, child,
                        defaults to adult.
  -b mm, --border-size mm
                        Specifies the dimension around the image that is
                        included (in mm). Defaults to 5.0 mm.
  -l mm, --line-size mm
                        Specifies the length of cutting lines in mm. Defaults
                        to 2.0 mm.

                        150.0 mm.
  -c, --check           Allows you to check the classification was correct by
                        creating additional help lines.
  -v, --verbose         Increases verbosity. Can be specified multiple times

## Example
Here is an image that is fed as a source. It is deliberately rotated. The
person on this image does not exist.

![Source image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe31415/gbpig/master/example.jpg)

When a 100 x 150mm image is genearted from this, this is the output:

![Output image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe31415/gbpig/master/example_print_me.jpg)

To check validity of results, you can specify the `--check` command line
option, in which case this is the output:

![Output image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe31415/gbpig/master/example_check_me.jpg)
